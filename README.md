# Project Happy Thoughts API
This weeks project was about building a full API including handling of user input, error handling and connect it with an existing frontend.

## The problem
Endpoints are:
GET /thoughts --> get thoughts

POST /thoughts --> post a thought 

POST /thoughts/:thoughtId/like --> post a like to a specific thought

PATCH /thoughts/:thoughtId --> update thought

DELETE /thoughts/:thoughtId --> delete thought
